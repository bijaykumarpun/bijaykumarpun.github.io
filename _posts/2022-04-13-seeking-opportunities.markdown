title: Seeking opportunities
---


I remember I was so well satisfied with my first programming job both in terms of pay and learning opportunity that I thought I would never actually leave that job. I still think what I felt at that time was something just about anybody would feel; but also because I was naiv√® and at very early stage in my career. But over time as I learnt more of my crafts, this feeling of satisfaction led me to being way too comfortable with the job, to the point that I wasn't looking forward to anything new, nor proactively trying to learn anything different. Then Covid hit and things changed.

That was some three years ago.

One thing that absolutely taught me to my core was to never get too comfortable with the job. For one that's always temporary, and two comfort is just that, comfort - and nothing different or better comes out of comfortness.

Since then, every time I got a sense of comfortness for a little too long, I had a mini panic attack. I felt the pressure to constantly look for better opportunities and find ways to improve.

In retrospect, this was good because it meant I was seeking opportunities to improve left and right, but it was also equally bad because I was so lost in looking for better opportunities that I never gave two thoughts about making full use of opportunities that I had at hand. 

Then it hit me - I had been seeking opportunities only for the shake of seeking them. This was/has been an extremely daunting realization lately. 

What's next ? I'm not quite sure. Working harder would be the default solution. Or perhaphs, slowing down the chase ? I can not afford another burn out in the days to come, so I think it's about time that I seek balance over anything else as regards to things I seek for improvements.
