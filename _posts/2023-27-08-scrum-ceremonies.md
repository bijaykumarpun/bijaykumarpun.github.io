#### Concept
To put it simply, scrum ceremonies are just meetings that allow stakeholders to be in sync with the product's progress/state.
```
Stakeholders:
- Project Managers
- Product Owners
- Team Managers/Leads
- Developers
- (Anyone with vested interest in the product eg. Leadership)
```
Scrum ceremonies are performed every sprint cycle, and in some cases every two/three weeks depending upon project's/team's needs.

##### 1. Sprint Planning
In Sprint Planning, sprint goals are finalized & tasks/tickets/action-items are drafted to the upcoming sprint, and likewise assigned to developers/stakeholders.

##### 2. Daily Standup
In Daily Standup, updates are provided on the tasks/tickets and inspected against the sprint goals.

##### 3. Sprint Review/Demo
Sprint Review is done at the end of the sprint, where a demo is provided on whatever was developed in the current sprint.

##### 4. Sprint Retrospective
In Sprint Retrospective, whatever went well or didn't go well throughout the sprint is discussed along with action items (improvement plans) to be implemented on the next sprint.

##### 5. Product Backlog Refinement
Backlog Refinement is when new tasks or uncompleted tasks from the previous sprints are reviewed/revised/re-prioritized.

##### 6. 1/1 Meetings
Not strictly a Scrum ceremony, but agile teams working remotely are generally expected to have 1/1 with their stakeholders to discuss/catchup on anything from either sides.


#### Preparing for meetings

It's super important that one is prepared ahead of time before attending the meetings; because Scrum meetings can be both time consuming as well as energy draining and sometimes spending hours in meetings can take away a lot of productive hours.
Top ways to handle meetings:
1. Be informed on the meeting's agenda, if not important then just skip!
2. Take note where needed; or have the meeting recorded if it's virtual
3. Participate in discussions proactively
