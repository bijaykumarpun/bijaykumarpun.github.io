### LTV (Lifetime Value)

The average revenue a user generates during their entire time using an app.
```
Formula (simplified):
LTV = ARPU × Average User Lifespan
(ARPU = Average Revenue Per User)  
```
- Helps to decide how much we can spend to acquire a user.
- Core to long-term profitability and valuation.

### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

```
Formula:
ARPU = Total Revenue / Number of Active Users
```
Example:
If earnings is $500 this month and had 1,000 active users:
```
ARPU = $500 / 1000 = $0.50
```

### CPI (Cost Per Install)
The average cost you pay in advertising to acquire one new install.
```
Formula:
CPI = Total Ad Spend / Number of Installs
```
- Tells how efficiently we’re acquiring users.
- Helps measure the performance of paid campaigns.


### Key Rule:

For profit:
- LTV must be greater than CPI
(i.e., we’re earning more from a user than it costs to get them)
