But if the concept is new or not well understood, it can quickly become confusing—and frustrating.

## What is Stakeholder Management?

In any project, there are *stakeholders*—people or entities with a vested interest in the project's outcome. While they may not be directly involved in building the product, it's still **critically important** for them to stay informed. Why? Because they may need to adjust priorities, provide input, or align other efforts based on the project's progress.

This need for visibility, however, isn't always obvious to those working hands-on with the project. Developers or contributors may be fully immersed in completing their tasks, focused on execution. For them, it might not be top of mind to consider what others need to know.

Here’s the catch:  
Those *not* working directly on the project don't have the same visibility. If no one communicates with them explicitly, things can become opaque. They may be left guessing about progress, risks, or delays—which leads to misalignment or dissatisfaction.

**That’s where stakeholder management comes in.**

## Why it Matters

Stakeholder management ensures that the *right people* have the *right information* at the *right time*. It’s about making sure everyone—especially those who need to stay in the loop—understands what’s happening, what the direction is, who’s responsible for what, and when things are expected to be delivered.

At its core, stakeholder management is **effective communication**. That’s the heart of it.

## Tips for Good Stakeholder Management

1. **Overcommunicate.**  
   When in doubt, share the update. It’s better to say something twice than not at all.

2. **Share timely updates.**  
   Even if progress is slow or blocked, keep stakeholders informed.

3. **Flag blockers early.**  
   Don't wait until it’s critical—if something’s in your way, raise it.

4. **Don’t go MIA.**  
   Going silent creates anxiety and confusion. Stay visible.

## A Word on Balance

While communication is essential, it's equally important to strike a balance. Constant updates can become noise. So yes—share progress, raise flags, but also:

- Say *no* when timelines are unrealistic.
- Push back on unreasonable demands.
- Manage expectations just as much as deliverables.

**In short:**  
Stakeholder management is not about bureaucracy—it's about *trust*, *transparency*, and *teamwork*. When done well, it keeps everyone rowing in the same direction.
