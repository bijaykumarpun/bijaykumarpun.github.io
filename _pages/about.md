Welcome to my profile - I'm a software developer and test automation engineer working remotely from Nepal [GMT+5:45].
<br><br>
See the dedicated <a href="/work">work</a> section for more details about my work.
<br><br>
Apart from the usual stuff, I like going out on long adventurous treks - really puts my legs to good use. I also like <a href="/blog">writing</a> - mostly on technical stuffs or things related to the tech-industry in general. 
<br><br>
Adapting to new technologies is a must in my field - so I'm always learning!
<br><br>
