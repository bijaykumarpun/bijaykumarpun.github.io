Namaste!

<br>
I'm a mobile app developer working remotely from Nepal.
<br><br>
Though I work with mobile technologies for the most part, web is also something I'm equally, if not more, passionate about.
<br><br>
Over the years, I've worked with teams across the globe - from lean startups to
<a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">YC-backed</a> unicorns. Many things changed, but one thing stayed the same i.e. my love for building stuff.
<br><br>
Right now, I'm more focused into building my own thing and seeing what sticks. So far, it has been an enjoyable ride.
