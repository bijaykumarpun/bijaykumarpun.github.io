Welcome to my profile - I'm a software developer and test automation engineer working remotely from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal">Nepal</a> [GMT+5:45].
<br><br>
See the dedicated <a href="/work">work</a> section for more details about my work - stuffs that I've built and tech-stacks I use.
<br><br>
Apart from the usual stuff, I like going out on long adventurous treks - really puts my legs to good use. I also like <a href="/blog">writing</a> - mostly on technical stuffs or things related to the tech-industry in general. 
<br><br>
Please use <a href="https://forms.gle/J5XxRkVjRFLWSBhS7">this form</a> to communicate with me. I will get back to you the soonest. (Don't worry, it's an anonymous form!)
<br><br>
Thank you for visiting.
