Hi I'm Bijay.<br>
I code for a living, and have been doing so for a few years now. I needed something to keep track of my personal projects and learning outcomes which is how this site came into existence. Some of the stuffs here may be interesting, while others not so much. Regardless, lets just say I tried to make the best use of what I had at my disposal.
<br><br>
In case you feel like reaching out to me, I would be happy to hear from you.
<br>
Good day!
