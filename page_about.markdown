Hi I'm Bijay.<br>
I code for a living, and have been doing so for a few years now. I needed something to keep track of my personal projects and learning outcomes which is how this site came into existence. Some of the stuffs here may be interesting, while others not so much. Regardless, they are here because they served their purpose - no matter how small.

Thank you for paying a visit!
