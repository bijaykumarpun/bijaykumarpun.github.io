> How a deliberate procrastination turned out to be a form of time management

I have dealt with procrastination almost as long as I can remember, yet I've always had this notion that given my circumstances I must be aiming at bigger things, and try to achieve more. These two conflicting states of mind really put me in a huge dilemma.

I think it's because of the lack of a proper system that worked in keeping me under a schedule, or the lack of desire to be under one, either way I barely managed to sort of deal with stuff from start to finish.

Hopefully, these three months of lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak did teach me something meaningful; that all I need to do is **just do it**, whatever it is. I think the first step is not to walk under in any system, but rather it is to stroll around and observe, find out what works and what doesn't. I could've spent the entire lockdown period trying to develop a proper system and put effort to work under it, but I didn't. Instead, I just did what felt correct at the momemnt. This somehow helped me get a lot of things done despite them being random at times and not an outcome of being under any system. Maybe if I was in a system outputs might have been more so to speak, but then the efforts put keep that system running would probably outweigh the effor to actually do something.

This takes me to the final and the actual point; procrastinate for the sake of procrastinating. This obviously sounds stupid but this takes first step of beating procrastination to the next level; the level two. In a nutshell, first one must do things at random without developing a system to keep track of, and when this is achieved, just put off things for later that do not fit the heat of the moment. Like for example this is morning time right now and I could be working on my Android project, but I don't anymore, because I've separated mornings for entirely different things now, so if anything isn't part of those **morning rituals** then I simply put them off for later.

And vola, welcome to step 2.
