&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	I'm just an average developer trying my best to not die in mediocrity. Luckily for me the desire to learn comes naturally, though I can be painfully selective on the subject. Having said that, I created this blog to keep track of those little things. <i>"Things that I'm learning"</i>, so to say. You may hardly find a complete article here, because almost all of the stuff I write here have been written while learning.
