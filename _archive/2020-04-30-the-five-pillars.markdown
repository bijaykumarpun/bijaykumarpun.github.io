This is a simple blog that I created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a lightweight blog-aware static site generator that's easy to use. I've hosted all the site data in [Github](https://github.com) as a Github Page, which means I can stay far away from all the hassle of having to maintain a database, or pay for hosting space. All contents are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with [Vim](https://www.vim.org) as the only editor. Now Vim is quite frankly a bit tedious to work with, but once you pass the learning curve, it becomes quite easy. That's four different tech stacks combined to serve this simple site. Also I intend to use [Bash Script](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash) in streamlining the blog composition task soon in the future. That will eventually make it five. Ha!
  
Now understandably, these tools seem a bit overkill, for lack of a better word, considering how simple this blog is. But there are a few different reasons why I chose this setup, and why I'm really happy with it. To be honest, I could just use something like Wordpress and be done with it, but where is all the fun in that? 

 Without going too much into detail, I just feel like these tools are `just right`, for whatever reason I can't put into words here. Just writing this post made me learn how to create tables in markdown. So I guess it's understandable where I'm going with this.

All in all, I'm really excited!
Wuhuu!!!
